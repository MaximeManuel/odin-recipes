        Pour-over coffee is a nostalgic brewing method that produces a rich, flavorful cup of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>The measurements in this recipe produce a 10-ounce  really nice cup from medium roast coffee.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="col"> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Grind 2/3 ounce (18 grams) of coffee beans to medium-fine. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add 10 oz to a gooseneck kettle and heat it on the stove until it reaches between 195 F and 205 F. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add your coffee beans to your filter. Beginning in the center of the coffee grounds and working your way around, pour just enough water (about 1 3/4 ounces / 50 milliliters) from the kettle to wet all of the coffee. 
            Let it bloom and saturate the coffee for between 30 and 45 seconds. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Continue to slowly pour water over the bed of coffee. 
            Work in even circles, starting in the middle and moving outwards.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            After pouring the full 10 oz, the goal is to have a total brewing time of 3 to 4 minutes for medium roast coffee and as little as 2 1/2 to 3 minutes for a dark roast.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Filter the beans from the coffee. Pour slowly and stop as needed to avoid overflowing the filter. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Serve and enjoy ❤️</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3 class="col"> Tips </h3>
    <ul >
        <li>With different beans and roasts, or depending on your personal taste, adjustments should be made. Experiment with the ratio, grind size, water temperature, and brewing time to find your ideal match, then repeat it. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Want to eliminate the filter's "paper" taste? Rinse it with hot water in the cone before adding the ground coffee (you'll heat the cup simultaneously). </li>
    </ul>
