    <p> This simple brewing method produces a richer, sweeter flavor with the true taste of coffee beans. It's almost as concentrated as espresso, but without the bitter taste or high acidity of hot-brewed coffee.
    </p>

    <p>Freshly ground coffee beans and cold or room temperature water are the only ingredients needed.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Grind 1 cup of coarsely ground coffee beans. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            In a large jar, add the ground coffee. Slowly pour 4 cups of water over the beans as you stir until the coffee is thoroughly saturated. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            over the container with a lid or plastic wrap. Place it in the refrigerator and let it steep for at least 12 hours.  
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
        Filter the beans from the coffee. Pour slowly and stop as needed to avoid overflowing the filter. 
        </li>
