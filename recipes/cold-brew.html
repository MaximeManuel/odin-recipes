    <p> This simple brewing method produces a richer, sweeter flavor with the true taste of coffee beans. It's almost as concentrated as espresso, but without the bitter taste or high acidity of hot-brewed coffee.
    </p>

    <p>Freshly ground coffee beans and cold or room temperature water are the only ingredients needed.</p>
